            <p>Join us for the next methods lunch on Virtual Soundscapes and the AudioDome! With the growing interest in using the technology, this session is designed to inform researchers about the potentials and limitations of the device, and to provide some programming and design tips for those who are designing their experiments using Audiodome.

                The session will begin with an overview of soundscapes, spatial hearing, and virtual auditory environments, highlighting their strengths and limitations. The second half will be hands-on, with Nima demonstrating how to operate the AudioDome, use its interface, and implement a compatible Python class for soundscape control.
